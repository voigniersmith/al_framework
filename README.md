# Raylib Framework

## Description

This is a project framework project; it is meant to be a starting point for future graphics projects.
Implemented in C++, the goal of this project is to create a starting point where the code is understood
in full by the contributors.

## Requirements

## Setup

### MacOS

`brew install raylib`

### Vim

For learning purposes, we suggest using vim and everything amazing that it contains. There are two videos
in the resources section that are very helpful for going from a vim-beginner to a vim-intermediate user.

This project has support for ctags. Please check the [Makefile Support](#makefile-support) section.

## Makefile Support

### `make`

### `make clean`

### Git

Auto pushing to a user's `stage` branch.

### CTags

This is for generating the `tags` file.

### Bear

This is for generating `compile_commands.json`.
